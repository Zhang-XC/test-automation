# Automated Test Suite

A Python-based test automation tool. It allows easy management of test cases using 
YAML and automates test execution and Allure reporting with Jenkins CI support.

## Features
-   YAML-based test case definition and dynamic request data injection
-   Automated test execution using `pytest`
-   Rich HTML reports generated with Allure
-   Jenkins pipeline configured for continuous integration and report publishing
-   Dependency management via `uv` and `pyproject.toml`

## Prerequisites
-   Python 3.12+
-   `uv` installed
-   [Allure CLI](https://allurereport.org/docs/install/) installed and added to your system PATH
-   (Optional) [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/download/) installed and configured

## Running Locally
> **Note:** Before running, ensure your environment's Python module search path 
includes the project root directory.

1. Start the backend server:
```
cd backend
uv run app.py
```

2. In a new terminal, run the test suite:
```
cd test_framework
uv run main.py
```

3. The Allure report can be found at `./report/html` after tests complete.

## Jenkins Integration

**What Jenkins does** \
Jenkins automates running your backend, executing tests, and archiving Allure 
reportsâ€”tasks you'd otherwise run manually. It continuously monitors your code 
changes and performs these steps automatically at the *triggers* you defined.

**Pipeline setup** \
Jenkins uses a *pipeline* to define the CI/CD operations. The pipeline for this
project is defined in `Jenkinsfile`. For details on Jenkins pipelines, see 
[Jenkins Documentation](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/).

**Triggers** \
Configure one of the following options to trigger Jenkins builds automatically:
-   **Poll SCM**: Jenkins checks your repo on regular time intervals.
-   **Webhook**: Jenkins get triggered at Git pushes.

## Allure Report
The automated test results are published as an Allure Report. The latest report is automatically generated by Jenkins and deployed to the `gh-pages` branch.

## Deployment
This project is fully deployed on **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** using an [AWS EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) instance.
